## 0. If you only read one thing in this beginner guide

If you just want the short version, here it is:

- **Follow the main story first** until the game stops dumping new systems on you.  
- **Pick one weapon you like and stick to it** for a while instead of swapping every five minutes.  
- **Don’t hoard difficulty pride** – it’s okay to turn it down.  
- **Spend some time just walking, climbing and gliding** – the world is the main reward.  
- **You don’t have to touch every menu and system on day one.** It’s fine to ignore half the UI for now.

The rest of this beginner guide is a simple “first few hours” checklist so the game feels playful instead of overwhelming.

## 1. Before you hit “Start Game”

### 1.1 Choose comfort over ego with difficulty

Where Winds Meet lets you adjust difficulty.

- If you mainly care about the **story and the world**, start on **Normal** or even lower.  
- If you love challenge, bump it up later after you understand the basics.

You don’t get a special medal for suffering in the tutorial.  
Let the game be welcoming first, punishing later.

### 1.2 Spend 5 minutes in the settings

It’s boring, but it pays off:

- **Turn on subtitles.**  
- **Lower motion blur / camera shake** if you’re sensitive to that.  
- **Rebind dodge / jump** to buttons that make sense for you.  
- If you’re on **controller**, stick with it – the combat and movement feel good there.

These tiny tweaks are the difference between “this feels clunky” and “oh, this actually feels good”.

## 2. Your first 30 minutes in Where Winds Meet

### 2.1 Follow the golden main-quest path

Early on, the game throws a lot at you: pop-ups, menus, currencies, systems.

For the **first 30–60 minutes**, do this:

- **Just follow the main quest marker.**  
- Ignore most side icons unless they’re literally on your way.  
- Treat this time as a **guided tour** of basic movement, combat, and a few key NPCs.

Think of it as the game saying:  
> “Let me show you around before you start wandering off.”

### 2.2 Don’t fight every enemy you see

It’s tempting to test every skill on every bandit.

Better rule:

- Fight when the game clearly wants you to learn something.  
- If you’re low on health, **run, glide, or use rooftops**. You’re not dishonored for disengaging.

This is a big open world, not a corridor beat ’em up.  
Survival and curiosity matter more than clearing every road.

## 3. Hour 0–1: unlock comfort first, power second

### 3.1 Boundary stones are your safety net

Any time you see a **boundary marker / stone**:

- Interact with it.  
- It **unlocks fast-travel** and usually **heals you**.

Get into the habit:  
> New area → look around → “Where’s the boundary stone?”

It makes experimentation much less scary.

### 3.2 Aim for a mount early

Moving faster = less boredom = more fun.

- Follow early quests until the game naturally leads you to **horse-related content**.  
- Once you have a **horse**, suddenly everything feels closer and more doable.

If you stumble into a place like a **horse farm** where you can catch and sell horses later, remember it. That’s early-game side income and mobility in one.

### 3.3 Don’t rush into irreversible-feeling choices

There’s a story moment where you can **burn down your little home base**.

The game frames it dramatically; it’s easy to hit “yes” on impulse.

General rule:

- If you see a big, dramatic prompt and you’re not sure:  
  **Pause, finish the current story beat, then decide.**  
- The game often lets you come back later with more context.

You don’t have to min-max, but avoiding one or two early “oh no” choices will keep your mood much better.

## 4. Weapons, skills and builds: keep it stupid simple

### 4.1 Pick **one** main weapon for now

The game gives you multiple weapon types and lots of martial skills.

For the first few hours:

- Pick **one weapon** whose **basic moves feel good** (sword, spear, umbrella, etc.).  
- Use it as your **default**.  
- Only swap to others for fun, not because you feel “behind”.

Your goal is not “perfect build in 2 hours”.  
Your goal is “I don’t have to relearn buttons every fight”.

### 4.2 Spend early resources like this

Until you understand systems better, use this rule:

- **Invest small, spread slowly.**  
  - A few levels into your main weapon.  
  - A few key skills that feel natural to use.  
- Don’t dump everything into a random skill tree you don’t fully get yet.

Think of it as test-driving:  
You’re learning how the car handles before installing expensive parts.

### 4.3 You can ignore half the menus for now

Early on, you’ll see:

- Internal arts, talents, reputations, social stuff, housing, cosmetics…

For the first 3 hours, you can safely:

- **Ignore most long-term progression trees.**  
- Focus on:  
  - weapon + basic skills  
  - movement  
  - boundary stones  
  - main story

If a system feels like homework, put it on the “later” pile.

## 5. Exploration: make the world work for you

### 5.1 Say yes to curiosity, no to compulsive checklisting

There are countless icons and points of interest.

Healthy mindset:

- If something **catches your eye**, go check it out.  
- If the map is screaming at you with side icons, **don’t feel obliged** to clear them all.

You’re not paid by the hour to do chores.  
You’re here to **have little “oh wow” moments** in a martial arts world.

### 5.2 Don’t forget to just… stand and look

It sounds cheesy, but it matters:

- Take a minute on a rooftop at sunset.  
- Glide off a mountain just to see where you land.  
- Walk through a market at night and listen to NPC chatter.

A lot of player reviews say their favorite moments are simply **existing in the world**, not just chasing stats.

Let yourself have those moments early; they’re free mood boosts.

---

## 6. Social and online systems: opt-in, not mandatory

### 6.1 You can play it like almost-single-player

Despite the MMO-style systems, you can:

- Play the main story almost entirely solo.  
- Treat other players as “people who happen to be in your world”, not obligations.

Don’t feel you have to join a group, clan, or meta grind on day one.

### 6.2 Be careful with crime and bounty until you understand it

The game lets you do some questionable things:

- Harassing NPCs  
- Causing trouble in certain areas  
- Getting chased by guards or even other players

Early rule of thumb:

- If you’re not sure what a system does, **don’t go full criminal** yet.  
- Keep your bounty low until you actually want that experience.

You can experiment with chaos later, when dying doesn’t feel like wasted learning.

## 7. A simple first 3 hours checklist for Where Winds Meet beginners

You don’t have to follow this strictly, but it’s a good rhythm:

**Hour 0–1**

- [ ] Adjust settings (controls, camera, subtitles).  
- [ ] Pick a difficulty that feels safe, not macho.  
- [ ] Follow the main quest; don’t chase every side icon.  
- [ ] Unlock a few boundary stones, get a feel for movement and gliding.  

**Hour 1–2**

- [ ] Pick one main weapon that feels good and stick with it.  
- [ ] Put a few levels into that weapon plus key skills.  
- [ ] Unlock a mount or get closer to it.  
- [ ] Visit at least one town, talk to a doctor, understand how healing and rest work.  

**Hour 2–3**

- [ ] Do 1–2 side quests that genuinely interest you.  
- [ ] Try one slightly tougher fight on your chosen difficulty.  
- [ ] Take 10 minutes to just explore with no objective.  
- [ ] Make a mental list: “things I want to learn later” (builds, housing, fashion) – and then let them wait.

If, after these first 3 hours, you:

- know how to move,  
- like how your main weapon feels,  
- and have had at least **two small “this is cool” moments**,  

then you’ve set yourself up well.  
The rest of the game will make a lot more sense from here.

## 8. Final note

Where Winds Meet throws a lot at new players.  
You don’t have to master it in a weekend.

Let the first few hours be:

- **gentle**,  
- **a bit messy**,  
- and focused on **fun and curiosity**, not perfection.

If the world feels good to be in, that’s already a success.
