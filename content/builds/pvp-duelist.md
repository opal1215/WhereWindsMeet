# PVP Duelist Build - Swift Shadow

This build is for the competitive player who wants to test their skills against others. It relies on reflexes, mind games, and perfect execution.

## Build Overview

The Swift Shadow build is the king of **1v1 Arena**. You are faster than anyone else, and if you play correctly, you can win without taking a single hit.

### Key Features

- **Reactionary Defense**: Your defense is not armor, it's your Parry skill.
- **Burst Windows**: You whittle opponents down, then delete them with a combo when they make a mistake.
- **Mind Games**: Use Smoke Bomb and feints to confuse your opponent.

## Detailed Rotation

There is no set "rotation" in PVP, but here are your combos:

1. **The Punish**: (Successful Parry) → Fatal Thrust → Lightning Strike
2. **The Harass**: Hidden Dart → Flash Step (In) → Light Attack → Flash Step (Out)
3. **The Escape**: Smoke Bomb → Roll → Heal/Reset

## Gear Recommendations

### Primary Stats Priority
1. Attack Speed (Animation speed is king in PVP)
2. Agility (Movement & Dodge)
3. Precision (Armor Penetration)

### Best in Slot Gear
- **Weapon**: Grandmaster's Lightning Saber
- **Armor**: Duelist's Silk Robes (Light Armor)
- **Accessories**: Ring of the Wind + Amulet of Focus

## Advanced Tips

- **Stamina Management**: Never let your stamina hit zero. You need it to dodge.
- **Cooldown Tracking**: Try to count your opponent's cooldowns. Engage when their CC is down.
- **Ping**: This build is very ping-sensitive. If you have high latency, consider a tankier build.
