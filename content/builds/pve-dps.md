# PVE DPS Build - Infernal Twinblades

This build focuses on maximizing burst damage and sustained DPS through aggressive dual blade combat. It requires precise timing and positioning but rewards skilled players with top-tier damage output.

## Build Overview

The Infernal Twinblades DPS build is designed for players who want to deal maximum damage in PVE content. This build excels in boss fights and dungeon runs where you can maximize your damage windows.

### Key Features

- **High Burst Damage**: Capable of dealing massive damage in short windows
- **Mobility**: Shadow Step and Dancing Shadows provide excellent positioning tools
- **Execute Potential**: Executioner's Dance makes finishing off bosses incredibly satisfying
- **Skill Ceiling**: Rewards players who master the rotation and mechanics

## Detailed Rotation

1. **Opener**: Shadow Step → Blade Fury (buff) → Phantom Strike
2. **Main Rotation**: Alternate Phantom Strike and Dancing Shadows while maintaining Blade Fury
3. **Execute Phase**: When boss drops below 30% HP, use Executioner's Dance
4. **Cooldown Management**: Always have Shadow Step ready for mechanics

## Gear Recommendations

### Primary Stats Priority
1. Critical Chance (aim for 45%+)
2. Attack Speed (30%+ minimum)
3. Agility (80 points)
4. Strength (60 points)

### Best in Slot Gear
- **Weapon**: Infernal Twinblades
- **Armor**: Assassin's Leathers (Critical Chance set)
- **Accessories**: Shadow Ring + Flame Amulet

## Advanced Tips

- **Animation Canceling**: Learn to cancel Dancing Shadows recovery with Shadow Step
- **Positioning**: Always attack from behind for bonus damage
- **Blade Fury Timing**: Refresh the buff before it expires to maintain 100% uptime
- **Boss Mechanics**: Use Shadow Step defensively to avoid one-shot mechanics

## Alternatives and Variations

If you don't have Infernal Twinblades yet, Celestial Daggers work well as a substitute. The rotation remains the same, but you'll have slightly lower damage and more emphasis on critical strikes.
