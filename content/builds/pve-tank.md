# PVE Tank Build - Iron Fortress

This build is designed for players who enjoy being the unshakeable pillar of their team. While you won't top the damage charts, your ability to survive lethal attacks and control the battlefield is what allows your team to succeed.

## Build Overview

The Iron Fortress build focuses on **Damage Mitigation**, **Aggro Management**, and **Crowd Control**. You are the first line of defense.

### Key Features

- **Unkillable**: With proper cooldown management, you can tank hits that would one-shot other classes.
- **Team Protector**: Your taunts and stuns keep enemies away from your fragile DPS teammates.
- **Steady Progression**: Unlike DPS builds that rely on crit RNG, tanking is consistent and reliable.

## Detailed Rotation

1. **Engage**: Charge → Taunting Roar (Gather Aggro)
2. **Active Mitigation**: Activate Iron Skin before taking hits
3. **Crowd Control**: Use Earthquake to stun groups of mobs
4. **Interrupt**: Save Shield Bash for when the boss starts casting a big spell

## Gear Recommendations

### Primary Stats Priority
1. Vitality (Health Pool)
2. Defense (Physical/Magical Mitigation)
3. Tenacity (Crowd Control Resistance)

### Best in Slot Gear
- **Weapon**: Guardian's Greatsword
- **Armor**: Warlord's Plate Set
- **Accessories**: Ring of the Mountain + Amulet of Stone

## Advanced Tips

- **Positioning**: Always turn the boss *away* from your team.
- **Cooldown Trading**: Don't use all defensive skills at once. Rotate them.
- **Resource Management**: Ensure you always have enough stamina to block.
